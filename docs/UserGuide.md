Social Worker's Efficiency Enhancer (**SWEE**) is a **desktop application for managing your contact details, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  
If you can type fast, SWEE can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.  
This is ideal as you do not often bring a mouse out with you on site visits to clients or on the go.
<br>
## Who is it for and what can it do for me?
This application is intended for people involved with social work, social workers, volunteers, and community partners who
have a need to manage contacts and their associated information. We offer a quick way for you to store their name, address,
phone number, email and notes about them. We also support tagging contacts for easier searching. Additionally, we offer a way to
keep track of upcoming appointments with them.

<div class="page-break"></div>

### Setting up the application

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. You can find a copy [here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11).  
   Java is needed to run the applications.

1. Download the latest `SWEE.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/releases). We will refer to it as the jar file or the application from now on.

1. Copy the jar file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

    1. Open the application in a way that suits your operating system. For example, on Windows, you can just double-click the file.<br>
       Shortly after, a graphical interface (GUI) like the one shown below should pop up. Take note that the app already includes some example data for you to see.<br>
       ![Ui](images/Ui.png)
    2. On first launch, it will present you with some example clients to show you a rough idea of how clients will look like.<br>
       Feel free to delete them and add your own. They are used in the [New User tutorial](#new-user-tutorial).
    3. This _home folder_ will contain files generated and used by SWEE.
    4. ðŸš¨ In case double clicking does not work, open a command line terminal in the home directory and run
       `java -jar SWEE.jar`

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Refer to the [New user tutorial](#new-user-tutorial)

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

1. ðŸ’¡ðŸš¨ Note that some screenshots may be outdated as the application constantly evolves. However you will still be able to get the full use and understanding from the information displayed in the GUI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### New User Tutorial

If you are a new user you can follow this tutorial and get a quick rundown of the application and its core features!  
This assumes a fresh installation of SWEE with the example clients serving as an example.<br><br>
**For a detailed rundown of each command, please refer to the [Features](#features) section that is after this tutorial.** <br><br>

#### Introduction to the user interface
![](images/UiAnnotated.png)

The user interface is primarily divided into 4 regions are shown by the different boxes.

1. This is the Command Box. Commands are typed here and carried out by the application.
2. Messages from the command that was run are displayed here. If the command runs into a problem, it will display here as well.
   For example if the user typed in an invalid command or something unexpected caused the program to not work.
3. This is the client list. Clients are displayed here in cards, see below. It is scrollable meaning you can navigate down and up like a webpage or word document.
4. A Client card holds information relevant to each client. The number beside the names of each user is the index.
   This index is used in some commands to specify the client being edited. The words in brown boxes are tags a
   client have. It shows all their details along with the number of appointments and next upcoming appointment if any.

<div class="page-break"></div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format and screenshots:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add --name=NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `--name=NAME [--tags=TAG]` can be used as `--name=John Doe --tags=friend` or as `--tags=John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[--tags=TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `--tags=SECDC`, `--tags=NECDC --tags=FinAid` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `--name=NAME --phone=PHONE_NUMBER`, `--phone=PHONE_NUMBER --name=NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div class="page-break"></div>

#### Adding a new client

Lets start by adding a new client. You can copy the command below for an example:

<code>
add --name=Theodore Koo --phone=98001715 --email=theodore@example.com  
--addr=Prince Street, Block 144, #19-14 --tags=Disabled --note=Lactose Intolerant
</code>

1. `add` This is the command for adding new contacts.
2. `--name=Theodore Koo` specifies the name parameter as Theodore Koo.
3. `--phone=98001715` specifies the phone number.
4. `--email=theodore@example.com` specifies the email parameter as `theodore@example.com`.
5. `--addr=Prince Street, Block 144, #19-14` indicates the address parameter. You are providing the address as `Prince Street, Block 144, Apartment 19-14`.
6. `--tags=Disabled` is used to assign a tag or label to the contact. In this case, you're labeling or tagging the contact as 'Disabled'.
7. `--note=Lactose Intolerant` specifies a note to be attached to this contact's information. The note here is 'Lactose Intolerant'.
   This is useful to attach additional information about an user.

You should see something similar to below.

![](images/new-user-tutorial/addCommand.png)

If you scroll to the bottom, you should see the client card of the newly added client.

<div class="page-break"></div>

#### Editing a client

What happens if you made a typo or if information become outdated? `edit` provides a handy way to edit a client.

```
edit 7 --name=Theo --tags=WalkingImpediment
```

1. `edit` This is the command for editing a client.
2. `7` refers to the index of the client we are editing.
3. `--name=Theo` specifies the name parameter as Theo. This sets the client's new name.
4. `--tags=WalkingImpediment` removes all existing tags and Theo now only has this tag.

![](images/new-user-tutorial/editCommand.png)

<div class="page-break"></div>

#### Finding a client by name

Now, we will find clients by their name.

```
find-name theo
```

1. `find-name` This is the command for finding a client by their name.
2. `Theo` specifies the name parameter as Theo. This sets the keyword for the search.
    1. It is possible to have more than 1 word, see [`find-name`](#locating-clients-by-name-find-name).
3. The client list will now display every client whose name contains at least one word in the keywords given.

![](images/new-user-tutorial/findNameCommand.png)

#### Finding a client by tag

Similarly, we can also find clients by their assigned tags.

```
find-tag WalkingImpediment
```

1. `find-tag` This is the command for finding a client by their name.
2. `WalkingImpediment` specifies the tag parameter as WalkingImpediment. This sets the keyword for the search.
   1. It is possible to have more than 1 tag, see [`find-tag`](#locating-clients-by-tag-find-tag).
3. The client list will now display every client whose tag contains at least one word in the keywords given.<br>
    In this case, the exact same client will be shown as he is the only client with the `WalkingImpediment` tag.

<div class="page-break"></div>

#### Viewing a client

Now we view a client at the specified index.

```
view 1
```

1. `view` This is the command for viewing a specific client.
2. The index is based on the current displayed clients.
3. The information is shown in the command result box.

[//]: # (![]&#40;images/new-user-tutorial/findNameCommand.png&#41;)

<div class="page-break"></div>


#### Deleting a client

Now we delete a client at the specified index.

```
del 1
```

1. `del` This is the command for deleting a specific client.
2. The index is based on the current displayed clients.
    1. ðŸ’¡ Observe that for commands using client index, it is always the index of the currently displayed clients.
3. The command shows the name of the client being deleted in the command result box.

[//]: # (![]&#40;images/new-user-tutorial/findNameCommand.png&#41;)

<div class="page-break"></div>


#### Listing all clients

Now with an empty list, we run a command to show **all** clients.

```
list
```

1. `list` This is the command for listing all clients.

[//]: # (![]&#40;images/new-user-tutorial/findNameCommand.png&#41;)

<div class="page-break"></div>


#### Exiting SWEE

Data is stored between usage of the application. We will exit and open the app again.

```
exit
```

1. `exit` This is the command for exiting the application.
2. Open the application again. The clients are still there.

<div class="page-break"></div>


#### Scheduling an appointment for clients

Observe that Natasha (index 5) has no appointments. We will schedule an appointment.  
Make sure to **set the date after today**.

```
sched 5 --title=Lunch --from=14/05/2024 15:00 --to=14/05/2024 15:20 --addr=VivoCity
```

1. `sched` This is the command for scheduling an appointment for a client.
2. `5` is the index of Natasha.
3. `--title=` is used to indicate the title of the appointment.
4. `--from=` and `--to=` specifies the start and ending date and time respectively.
5. The format is `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`: days/Months/year Hour:Minutes. The hours are in 24 hours format.
6. If you set the date to be in the future, you will realise the display of next appointment have changed as well.
7. Observe that the total number of appointments increased.
8. To see all of a client's appointment use the `view` command, try `view 2` to see Hu Tao's appointments.


<div class="page-break"></div>


#### Unscheduling an appointment for clients

Observe that Hu Tao (index 2) has 2 appointments. We will unschedule an appointment.

```
unsched 2 --appt=2 
```

1. `unsched` This is the command for unscheduling an appointment for a client.
2. `2` is the index of Natasha.
3. `--appt=` specifies the index of the appointment to unschedule. In this case 2.

<div class="page-break"></div>

### Adding a client: `add`

Adds a client to the address book.

Format: `add --name=NAME --phone=PHONE_NUMBER --email=EMAIL --addr=ADDRESS [--tags=TAG] --note=NOTES`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A client can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

**Important**
* You cannot leave tags empty, i.e. `add --tags=` with nothing for the tags.
* Note is a compulsory field. If you have nothing to write for note, write `--note=NA`.
* Note cannot take in multiple entries e.g. `--note=Urgent --note=Complex`.
* If you have more than one client with the same name, please differentiate them by giving them different names.
    * For example, you could include the clients' last names.
    * Note that clients with different names but same phone number, email or address can be added, as multiple clients might share such information.
* Names should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces.
* Please do not input any hyphens or spaces in the phone number field. Just input the phone number as a continuous string of numbers.

Examples:
* `add --name=John Doe --phone=98765432 --email=johnd@example.com --addr=John street, block 123, #01-01 --note=Daughter is caretaker`

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags for a client, any pre-existing tags will be directly replaced with the new ones provided in the command.<br>
  This means that the tag update is not cumulative; unless a tag is specified in the new command, it will not be retained from the previous set of tags.<br>
  If the tag option is not specified, i.e. `--tags=`, the existing tags will be left as is.
* You can remove all the clientâ€™s tags by typing `--tags=` without
  specifying any tags after it.
* Note cannot take in multiple entries e.g. `--note=Urgent --note=Complex`.
    * This will only assign the latest note i.e. only `Complex` is assigned.

Examples:

### Saving the data

SWEE data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

SWEE data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, SWEE will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the SWEE to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **When adding tags that are longer than 202 characters**, the tag itself and tags below it may be unable to be displayed properly and can be cut off due to the maximum screen size. For tags of length **less than 200 characters**, the full tag can be viewed if the application is in full screen mode (as tested on a Macbook Air, the length may differ according to laptop size).
